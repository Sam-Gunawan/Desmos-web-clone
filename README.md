# Desmos Clone: A Hands-On HTML and CSS Project

This repo is a personal challenge to build a stripped-down version of the Desmos website (without the graphing calculator interface). It's all about diving deep into HTML and CSS to recreate the look and feel of a popular web app. I'm using this project to level up my skills in building clean, responsive, and visually appealing websites.

While this project focuses on HTML and CSS, it also serves as a precursor to integrating more complex JavaScript functionalities for interactive graphing capabilities. This repository is intended as a living document, evolving as the developer's skills progress. It is open to feedback and contributions, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Key features and goals:

- Accurate replication of Desmos' user interface elements
- Mastery of HTML and CSS for layout, styling, and responsiveness
- Adherence to best practices for code organization and readability
- Exploration of advanced CSS techniques (flexbox, grid, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements)
- Foundation for future integration of JavaScript for interactive graphing

I'm focusing on nailing the design first, using HTML structure and CSS styling to mimic Desmos' iconic look. Once the foundation is solid, I plan to add JavaScript for the interactive graphing part.

__This project is a work in progress, and I'm open to feedback and suggestions. It's a great way to learn and grow as a developer. This project is not affiliated with Desmos Studio PBC and is solely for educational and practice purposes.__
